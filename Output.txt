1.OUTPUT

Enter the number of people crossing the bridge:5
Enter timings for each person:1,2,4,7,11
person  0 timings  1
person  1 timings  2
person  2 timings  4
person  3 timings  7
person  4 timings  11
total timings for each person crossing bridge is: 24 

2. COMPUTATION OF TIME COMPLEXITY

Basic Note ;greedy algorithm -optimal solution 

greedy algorithm always seems to make a locally-optimal choice in the hope that choice will lead to globally-optinal solution 
steps 1: sort ,select and check less or greater to pass the time that it will take to complete to-do item into cuurentTime.
step 2:add one to numberofThings
step 3:Repeat this as long as the currentTime is less than or equal to T.

example:number of people crossung the bridge is 5 
let x=(1,2,4,7,11)

1:solution

after 1st iteration
<->currentTime=1(0)
number ofThings=0

after 2nd iteration
<->currentTime is 1<2   
number ofThings=2

after 3rd iteration
<->currentTime is 2<4 
number ofThings=4

after 4th iteration
<->currentTime is 3<7
number ofThings=7

after 5th iteration
<->currentTime is 4<11
number ofThings=11 

hence,
c(0)=0
c(1)=2
c(2)=4
c(3)=7
c(4)=11 total 0+2+4+7+11=24(optimal solution)
F=t1<t2............<tn

<->if  1,2 go 
return 2 

<->if 2,4 go
return 4 

<->if 4,7 go
return 7 

<->if 7,11 go
return 11 time taken =2+4+7+11=24(optimal solution)

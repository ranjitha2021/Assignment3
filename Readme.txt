1.TEAM DETAILS

Name:Ranjitha.H.D ,Susmita.B.K
USN:1KS19CS411 ,1KS19CS402

2.CONTRIBUTATION OF EACH TEAM MEMEBER 

<->WE BOTH SHARE DIFFERENT IDEAS AS I'VE BASIC SENSE IN PYTHON (RANJITHA) AND SHE HAVE BASIC SENSE IN C (SUSMITA).WE BOTH SAHRE IDEAS THROUGHT WHATSAPP  OR VIDEOCALL
<->ONCE I UNDERSTAND CONCEPT I WILL EXPLAIN HERE THROUGH CALL/VIDEOCALL ,AFTER WE BOTH GET CLARIFICATION WE WILL TRY IN DIFFERENT CONCEPT .
<->SHE WILL JUST SHARE CODE ONCE DONE ,AS USING SAME I WILL CONVERT IN PYTHON USING SOME MORE  FUNCTIONS(FOR AND WHILE),OBJECT(ATTRIBUTES AND BEHAVIOR),CLASS(CLASS PARROT: PASS) ,BRACKETS LIKE_[](NORMALLY USED FOR DICTIONARIES),()_(USED TO IDENTIFY PARAMS) ETC...... MAKE BETTER  ONE.
<-> ONCE ALL CODING PART DONE IF WE GET PROPER OUTPUT I WILL SHARE IN GITHUB .
<->HENCEFOURTH,UPDATE FEW MORE PART IS MY AS SHE WONT USE LAPTOP !

3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM 

<->RUN THE PROGRAM <->Enter the number of people crossing the bridge:"for example :5"<->Enter timings for each person:" for example:1,2,4,7,11"<->finally output will be shown:"for example:total timings for each person crossing bridge is: 24(Optimal solution)"

4.CHALLENGS FACED AND HOW DID WE DONE

<->AS FOR WELL KNOWING PERSON NEED AT LEAST 2 DAYS ,BUT FOR STARTER PERSON THEY NEED MORE THEN MONTH (AS US).
WE ARE FROM DIPLOMA LATER ENTRY WE WILL HAVE SOME BASIC IN CODEING COMPARE TO OTHERS ,BUT ALSO WE FACE DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE CONCEPT MEAN WHILE STRUGGLING ON SAME ! SO-FAR WE REFER SOME BOOKS OVERCOME WITH IT(DIPLOMA-DAA,DATA STRUCTURE,JAVA SCRIPT,ALGORITHMS AND C ECT)NOT ONLY BOOKS WE USED APP(GITHUB) AND GOOGLE (GEEKS-FOR-GEEKS)  WITHOUT ALL THIS REFERENCE SEEMS DIFFICULT TO DO.


5.WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT

<->TECHNIQUE(FOR SAME QUESTION USING DIFFERENT TIME COMPLEXITY:Example-we  use t1<t2<.....tn for our program but on same we can use t1+t2+.......+tj)
<->BASIC TO BETTER 
<->CONCEPT THINKING 
<->IDEAS 
<->TRACING PRACTICE
